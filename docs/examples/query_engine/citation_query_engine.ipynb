He also wrote simple games, a program to predict how high his model rockets would fly, and a word processor on a TRS-80 [3]. He studied philosophy in college, but switched to AI after being inspired by a novel and a PBS documentary [4]. He eventually started publishing essays online and wrote a collection of them that was reprinted as a book [8]. He also worked on spam filters, painted, cooked for groups, and bought a building in Cambridge [9].\n"
